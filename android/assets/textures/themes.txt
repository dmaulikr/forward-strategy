Current Textures for Themes:
Dark Theme - to make things easier for testing, I copied data from my app

Default - textures created by libgdx Pixmap Utility. Can create textures this way and add them to directory, pack them
and use them in a skin. NOTE: textures need to be created before loading skins.
